# Hang-Man
A basic version of a word guessing game called "Hang Man"

# Note:
This game is built only by using the Java Swing Designer in Eclipse IDE. So don't expect much graphics or VFX experience in it :)
I have included only the src part in the repo, so just copy all the files inside it to your src folder.
Run the home.java file first and follow the instructions given on the screen to dive into the game.
